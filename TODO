here i will implement Huffman coding in go

        O
    O       O
 a    b  c     d

11   10  01    00

encoding: abac -> 11101101
will use a mapping: {a: 11, ...}

decoding 000111 -> dca
done by recursiwely traversing graph

desired workflow - encoding a file
provided file path, you parse by words, interpuncuation and spaces
-> map[string]int32 - words with weights
